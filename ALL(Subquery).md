# SQL Query Explanation: Orders with Highest Total Price

## Overview
This document explains the SQL query that retrieves orders with a total price greater than any order shipped by a specific shipper (`shipper_id = 1`).

## SQL Query
```sql
SELECT order_id, product_id, (unit_price * quantity) AS total_order_price
FROM ordered_items
WHERE (unit_price * quantity) > ALL (
    SELECT (unit_price * quantity) AS total_order_price 
    FROM ordered_items 
    WHERE shipper_id = 1
);
```

## Breakdown of the Query
1. **Main Query:**
   - Selects `order_id`, `product_id`, and calculates `total_order_price` as `(unit_price * quantity)` from the `ordered_items` table.
   - Filters results to include only those where the total order price is greater than any order price from the subquery.

2. **Subquery:**
   - Selects `(unit_price * quantity) AS total_order_price` from the `ordered_items` table where `shipper_id = 1`.
   - This subquery returns all total order prices for orders shipped by shipper 1.

3. **`> ALL` Condition:**
   - Ensures that only orders whose total price is greater than all values returned by the subquery are included in the result.
   - This means the query retrieves orders with the highest total price compared to any order handled by `shipper_id = 1`.

## Example Output
| order_id | product_id | total_order_price |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 105      | 2001      | 500.00            |
| 110      | 2020      | 650.00            |

## Use Case
This query is useful for identifying high-value orders that surpass all orders handled by a specific shipper. It can be applied in:
- Performance analysis of shipping companies.
- Identifying premium orders requiring special handling.
- Competitive analysis among shippers based on order values.

## Notes
- If no order from `shipper_id = 1` exists, the query will return all records since `> ALL (empty set)` is always `TRUE`.
- Indexing `shipper_id`, `unit_price`, and `quantity` can improve performance.
- Be cautious of NULL values in `unit_price` or `quantity`, as they may affect calculations.
