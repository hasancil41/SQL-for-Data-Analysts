## SQL Query Explanation

This SQL query retrieves order details from the `ordered_items` table where the total price of an order (calculated as `unit_price * quantity`) is greater than or equal to the highest order total for a specific shipper (`shipper_id = 1`).

### Query Breakdown:

```sql
SELECT order_id, product_id, (unit_price * quantity) AS total_order_price
FROM ordered_items
WHERE (unit_price * quantity) >= ANY (
    SELECT MAX(unit_price * quantity)
    FROM ordered_items
    WHERE shipper_id = 1
);
```

### Explanation of Each Clause:
1. **`SELECT order_id, product_id, (unit_price * quantity) AS total_order_price`**
   - Retrieves the `order_id`, `product_id`, and calculates the `total_order_price` for each order.

2. **`FROM ordered_items`**
   - Specifies that the data is coming from the `ordered_items` table.

3. **`WHERE (unit_price * quantity) >= ANY (...)`**
   - Filters orders where the `total_order_price` is greater than or equal to at least one value in the subquery.

4. **Subquery:**
   - **`SELECT MAX(unit_price * quantity) FROM ordered_items WHERE shipper_id = 1`**
   - Finds the maximum `total_order_price` among all orders handled by `shipper_id = 1`.

### Use Case:
- This query helps identify orders that meet or exceed the highest order total for a specific shipper.
- Useful for analyzing top orders across different shipping partners.

### Potential Enhancements:
- If multiple shippers are involved, consider parameterizing `shipper_id` for flexibility.
- Instead of `ANY`, using `>= (SELECT MAX(...))` would yield the same results but may be clearer.

### Example Output:
| order_id | product_id | total_order_price |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1023     | 50        | 500               |
| 1056     | 12        | 520               |
| 1098     | 34        | 520               |
