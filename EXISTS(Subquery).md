# SQL Query Explanation: Filtering Customers with Orders

## Overview
This document explains the SQL query that retrieves customers who have at least one order in the `customer_orders` table using the `EXISTS` clause.

## SQL Query
```sql
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT customer_id 
    FROM customer_orders
);
```

## Breakdown of the Query
1. **Main Query:**
   - Selects all columns from the `customers` table.
   - Filters customers based on whether they have at least one record in `customer_orders`.

2. **Subquery with `EXISTS`:**
   - Checks if there exists any `customer_id` in `customer_orders`.
   - If at least one matching `customer_id` is found, the corresponding customer is included in the result.

## Example Output
| customer_id | first_name | last_name | email           |
|------------|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| 101        | John      | Doe       | john@example.com |
| 102        | Jane      | Smith     | jane@example.com |

## Use Case
This query is useful for:
- Identifying active customers who have placed at least one order.
- Filtering out customers who have never made a purchase.
- Optimizing marketing strategies by focusing on engaged customers.

## Notes
- The `EXISTS` clause is generally efficient since it stops checking as soon as it finds a match.
- If you need detailed order information along with customer details, consider using a `JOIN` instead.
- Ensure proper indexing on `customer_id` in both `customers` and `customer_orders` tables for performance optimization.
